📊 Dirty Cafe Sales Analysis — From Messy Data to Business Insights

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis case study on a synthetic 10,000-row “Dirty Cafe Sales” dataset, focusing on transforming corrupted transactional data into actionable business intelligence.

The dataset contained:

Type mismatches (numeric fields stored as text with "ERROR" values)

Missing categorical and numerical values

Logical inconsistencies (negative prices, invalid totals)

Instead of discarding corrupted rows, this project emphasizes data recovery, statistical imputation, and logical inference to preserve business value.

🔍 Project Objectives

Clean and standardize inconsistent transactional data

Apply statistically sound imputation techniques (Mode imputation)

Implement logical inference to reconstruct missing financial values

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Extract business-level insights for operational and revenue optimization

🛠 Technical Approach
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Type Enforcement

Converted corrupted numeric columns using pd.to_numeric(errors="coerce")

Parsed datetime columns with pd.to_datetime()

Identified and handled null patterns systematically

2️⃣ Missing Data Strategy

Mode imputation for categorical variables (Item, Location, Payment Method)

Preserved statistical distribution of high-frequency retail transactions

3️⃣ Logical Revenue Reconstruction

Implemented rule-based inference:

Total Spent = Quantity × Price


Recovered hundreds of incomplete transactions without data leakage.

4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis

Generated business-focused visualizations:

Sales volume by product

Revenue by service type (Takeaway vs In-store)

Monthly revenue trend analysis

📈 Key Business Insights

Juice significantly outperforms other products in volume → inventory & product expansion opportunity

Takeaway drives nearly 2× revenue vs in-store → operational optimization priority

Seasonal peaks in June & October; dip in February → predictive staffing & promotional strategy opportunity

🎯 Business Impact

This project demonstrates how disciplined data preprocessing directly influences strategic decisions:

Inventory optimization

Revenue stream prioritization

Operational planning

Seasonal forecasting
