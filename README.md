# Cafe_Sales_EDA_Cleaning_Insights
This project presents an end-to-end data analysis case study on a synthetic 10,000 row “Dirty Cafe Sales” dataset, focusing on transforming corrupted transactional data into actionable business intelligence.
The dataset contained:
•	Type mismatches (numeric fields stored as text with "ERROR" values)
•	Missing categorical and numerical values
•	Logical inconsistencies (negative prices, invalid totals)
Instead of discarding corrupted rows, this project emphasizes data recovery, statistical imputation, and logical inference to preserve business value.

**Project Objectives**
•	Clean and standardize inconsistent transactional data
•	Apply statistically sound imputation techniques (Mode imputation)
•	Implement logical inference to reconstruct missing financial values
•	Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Extract business-level insights for operational and revenue optimization

**Technical Approach**
**1. Data Cleaning & Type Enforcement**
•	Converted corrupted numeric columns using pd.to_numeric(errors="coerce")
•	Parsed datetime columns with pd.to_datetime()
•	Identified and handled null patterns systematically
**2. Missing Data Strategy**
•	Mode imputation for categorical variables (Item, Location, Payment Method)
•	Preserved statistical distribution of high-frequency retail transactions
**3. Logical Revenue Reconstruction**
Implemented rule-based inference:
Total Spent = Quantity × Price
Recovered hundreds of incomplete transactions without data leakage.
**4. Exploratory Data Analysis**
Generated business-focused visualizations:
•	Sales volume by product
•	Revenue by service type (Takeaway vs In-store)
•	Monthly revenue trend analysis

**Key Business Insights**
•	Juice significantly outperforms other products in volume → inventory & product expansion opportunity
•	Takeaway drives nearly 2× revenue vs in-store → operational optimization priority
•	Seasonal peaks in June & October; dip in February → predictive staffing & promotional strategy opportunity

**Business Impact**
This project demonstrates how disciplined data preprocessing directly influences strategic decisions:
•	Inventory optimization
•	Revenue stream prioritization
•	Operational planning
•	Seasonal forecasting

**Tech Stack**
•	Python
•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	Matplotlib / Seaborn
•	Jupyter Notebook
